well i wanna do the first algorithm which is selection sort.
First i'm gonna do it in javascript, 
because this is the language i've been working with the most.
And then i'm gonna do the same algorithm in python so i can
acquaint myself with it.

There're some terms i wanna highlight. 
Those are key and sattelite data. 
Now i don't see much need in them.
In selection sort i'm doing on arrays i have only keys.
And i can imagine tracking sattelite data in tables, 
but not in any data structre i know.

btw i don't quite like reading those proofs. I mean those with
loop invariants. Probably that's why i have problems making
a working loop with first attempt. It's sometimes just not very
obvious which value a loop termitates with.
